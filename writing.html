<h1>Writing</h1>
<h2>Posts for NPR's Social Media Desk blog</h2>

<br>

<p><strong>The low-down: </strong>Over the course of my internship, I wrote several articles for <a href="http://socialmediadesk.tumblr.com/">The Social Media Desk blog</a> about developing trends in social media related to podcasts.</p>

<a href="http://socialmediadesk.tumblr.com/post/115225116356/7-strategies-for-engaging-your-podcasts-audience"><h4>"7 Strategies For Engaging Your Podcast’s Audience"</h4></a>

<p>One of the first projects assigned to me as a product intern was to assess audience behavior and levels of engagement with NPR podcasts on social networks. After a month of research, I discovered that podcasts with higher levels of engagement (likes, comments, shares, etc.) tended to be shows that had discussion-based content, as opposed to story-driven content. I wanted to find out why, so I spoke with several podcast producers (from Invisibilia, Pop Culture Happy Hour, and Microphone Check) who ran successful social media spaces. After I gathered enough information, I wrote this blog post. It was later referenced on the <a href="http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/need-to-know/try-this-at-home/strategies-for-engaging-your-podcasts-audience-from-npr/">American Press Institute's newsletter</a> and was adapted for NPR training purposes.</p>


<a href="http://socialmediadesk.tumblr.com/post/117875589281/5-things-i-learned-about-podcast-culture-in-the"><h4>"5 Things I Learned About Podcast Culture In The U.K."</h4></a>

<p>It occurred to me later in my internship that almost all podcast content I'd listened to had been produced in the United States. Podcasts were gaining popularity in the U.S., but did that growth reflect internationally? What did podcast culture look like outside the U.S.? Although I didn't have enough time to conduct a thorough international investigation, I decided to go small and focus on the U.K.</p>

<a href="http://socialmediadesk.tumblr.com/post/112538997456/social-sandbox-where-news-lives"><h4>"Encouraging Engagement On Instagram"</h4></a>

<p>During my time at NPR, I managed the <a href="https://instagram.com/nprinterns/">NPR Interns instagram account</a>. This meant I organized takeovers twice a week for interns who wanted to participate. I would <a href="https://instagram.com/p/zvnhixxIE5/">interview</a> the intern a day before their takeover, take their photo, and hand over the account. My goal was to have content every day of the work week. This meant that I experimented with many different types of content and account management styles to get our audience more engaged. The blurb at the top of the post is the result of one those experiments.</p>

<a href="http://socialmediadesk.tumblr.com/post/111406979091/social-sandbox-every-day-were-tumbln"><h4>"The Verge + Snapchat"</h4></a>

<p>This was written at the beginning of 2015, when major news outlets were starting to experiment with content on Snapchat. I wrote a blurb about how The Verge managed their Snapchat account, putting emphasis on the fact that they posted content as if a single person were posting it, not as a media outlet, which made the experience feel much more authentic.</p>

	<h1>Liam Tully & Johnny Mei Website</h1>
	<h2>Website for singer-songwriter duo</h2>

	<br>

	<p><strong>The low-down: </strong>I created a website for a singer-songwriter using the values of visual music that we both connected to.</p>

	<p>
		One of my good friends, Liam Tully, needed a website to kick off his musical career with one of his best friends, Johnny Mei, in LA. We had worked together in the past on a previous project, a student-made feature-film titled <a href="/commencement.html">Commencement</a>. We both have deeply personal connections to music and I wanted to make sure that our love of music and simplicity were expressed coherently. 
	</p>

	<p>At first, I generated some standard mockups based off some photos and sketches Liam had sent me. We weren’t really enjoying the products then, it was an exploratory phase. </p>

	<!-- <b>The Process</b> -->
	<p>
		I was tasked by the Social Media team to create a card for this purpose. Using Sketch, I mocked up various layouts for different name lengths and options for journalists who did not have headshots. For example, if we had a headshot-less journalist who’s beat was legal affairs, we would include a relevant image of the Supreme Court in the background.
	</p>

	<!-- This one's bigger -->

	<!-- <b>The Solution</b> -->
	<p>
		After the cards were developed, I created a Photoshop template of the card to replace name, photo, time, and date information, as well as documentation to assist those through the process who are not familar with Photoshop. This documentation also included art guidelines to help the Social Media team select and use the appropriate types of images. This card was approved by both the Design and Marketing teams with NPR and is currently in use.

<h1>Featured Podcast Art</h1>
<h2>Unified brand visuals on social media</h2>

<br>

<p><strong>The low-down: </strong>I created original featured art for several NPR podcasts and coordinated with many producers to produce art for promotional purposes.</p>


<p>
	One of my final tasks as an intern at NPR was to unify featured artwork for different podcast providers. Previously, if you viewed (16:9) featured art on any of NPR’s podcasts on social media, you would find that most of them featured images that sometimes matched and often were over five years old, or were low quality, or didn’t have art at all. Additionally, if a podcast was featured on iTunes or on NPR’s updated podcast directory, there would need to be specific art designed for those purposes. 
<p>
	This project required as much, or more, coordination as it did designing. I corresponded with close to all 26 of NPR’s podcast producers to inquire whether or not they had existing art files, if they had any related images of the show, or if they had any basic ideas about how they wanted to go about making new art for the show. A few had great art ready to go, but most needed new art made. 
</p>

<p>
	Since this was such a large project, I was unable to finish it by the time I my internship ended. However, I did design original art for four shows (Planet Money, From The Top, World Cafe, and Storycorps), all of which was approved by the Design and Marketing teams. Additionally, I worked with other about seven producers who were able to get new art made for this purpose. After I was assigned to this project, the state of podcast art was in a much better place than I found it.

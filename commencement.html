	<h1>Commencement - The Film</h1>
	<h2>Student-produced feature film</h2>

	<br>

	<p><strong>The low-down: </strong>I served as Directory of Photography, Co-Editor, and Associate Producer on a feature length student film.</p>


	<p>
		At the end of spring of 2012, I was approached by two students, Romene Davis (producer) and Liam Tully (director), who wanted to make a feature-length film. They had come across my photography on Tumblr and asked if I wanted to be Director of Photography on this film. Because this was the first time I had an opportunity like this on that scale, I said yes.
	</p>

	<p>
		The next six months were spent writing the film. Ariel Quintana and Romene Davis wanted to explore race, sexuality, and gender themes on a predominately white college campus spanning across decades. Inspired by The Hours and Crash, the film takes place in three time periods: the 1940s, the 70s, and the 90s, each exploring a different theme. 

	</p>

	<p>
		After the film was written, we began pre-production meetings in December, casting the film (using students from the theater department), completing location scouting, and gathering equipment. I successfully lobbied for the student government to buy a Canon 60D that could be used to rent by other students. I also built a steadicam from parts I gathered at Home Depot, as well as slider rig. We also were able to borrow lighting equipment from the school photographer, as well as a high quality boom microphone from my uncle, a cinematographer. Because the film was so low budget, we had to save cost anywhere we could.

		Principal photography began in January of 2013. Since the film was produced, directed, shot, and acted by students, the producer had to plan the shoots around everybody’s busy academic schedules. We usually shot on the weekends, about 6 hours a shoot, filming two scenes each day. 
	</p>

	<p>
		These shoots were usually grueling, as it was everyone’s first time working on a project of this scale. A lot of hands on learning was required, like coordinating shots ahead of time, how to utilize lighting so that it reflected the mood of a certain scene, and keeping the morale of the crew and cast as high as we could. Shooting wrapped in May, right before finals.

		The film was edited over the next five months. Since there was hundreds of gigabytes of footage to parse through and a deadline by the end of October, myself and the sound producer, Greg, edited in tandem, dividing the work in half. Here was our workflow: using Adobe Premiere, After Effects, and DaVinci Resolve, Greg and I would both edit rough cuts and upload them to Youtube as unlisted so that other members of the team could give notes. Typically, each scene would go through 7-10 revisions. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We finally premiered the film in November of 2014 to an audience of over 100 students and faculty. Original music composed for the film was performed by the director and his co-writer, Johnny Mei, a Q&A was hosted with the cast and crew. The film has collected over 300 views on Vimeo.

	<p>
		Looking back on the project, there are many things I would go back and fix. The camera work, the editing, and the script itself all make me cringe whenever I rewatch it. But, given the time we had and everyone’s willingness to dive headfirst into a film of this scale, I am immensely proud of all the work that had gone into the year and half long project.

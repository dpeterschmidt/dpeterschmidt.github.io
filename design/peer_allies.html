	<h1>Peer Allies</h1>
	<h2>Sexual assault resource for students</h2>

	<br>

	<p><strong>The low-down: </strong>I was a designer and developer on a team that created a sexual assault resource app.</p>
	
	<p>
		During my last class in Computer Science, the professor tasked students with developing web apps for groups on campus. The goal was to make a functioning product that had positive effects on the local community. The project used Agile scrum to good teamwork and stakeholder communication.

	<p>
		My team worked with Peer Allies, a group that supports survivors of sexual violence. The success of the group depended on their outreach effort. The more people that knew about them, the more likely survivors would drop by office hours.
	</p>

	<p>
		The stakeholder wanted to supplement this word by mouth process with an online app. This way, survivors could have an alternate way of engaging with allies. On the site, you could view the allies, schedule an appointment, and find out more about the group. The stakeholder also wanted special admin functions for the Allies.
	</p>

	<p>
		I worked on a team of five, each person responsible for a different task. Luckily, each person specialized in a different field. We used a Ruby on Rails framework, Git, Heroku, and Slack to organize ourselves. I was in charge of front-end development and design, so I used the Bootstrap framework.

	<p>
		My goal was to make navigation and design as simple as possible, so survivors would engage. If the UX appealed to survivors, it would be more likely they would contact an ally. I used a friendly, light blue and white as the color scheme, as well as a nice, sans-serif font. Responsive design was also implemented to ensure a unified experience on any device.

		The University of Puget Sound is currently implementing the site and should be available in the Fall of 2015. As such, the <a href="https://tranquil-cliffs-4819.herokuapp.com">link</a> provided is an almost final version.

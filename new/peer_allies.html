	<h1>Peer Allies</h1>
	<h2>Sexual assault resource for students</h2>

	<!-- <b>The Problem</b> -->
	<p>
		During the Fall 2014 semester, groups of students in the Software Engineering class were tasked with developing web applications for different groups on campus. The goal was to make a functioning app that these organizations could use as real apps that could have tangible effects on the community. Part of the process was using Agile scrum to not only ensure that good, equal work was done between team members, but so that teams could be in direct contact with their stakeholder to make sure that the app was satisfying their needs. 

	<p>
		Our team worked with Peer Allies, a support network of students* that hold weekly "office hours" to provide an opportunity for survivors of sexual violence or harassment. Before the app was developed, students in this group (the Peer Allies) held “office hours” throughout the week, so that survivors who wished to speak to someone about their experience could in an anonymous setting.

		The stakeholder wanted to supplement this word by mouth process with an online app, so that survivors could accomplish more things in a convenient time: view who the allies were, schedule an appointment with an ally, view safety documentation, and find out more information about the group.
		Concurrently, the stakeholder also wanted special behaviors for admins (the Allies), which included the ability to edit Ally info, something else, something else, email.
	</p>

	<!-- <b>The Process</b> -->
	<p>
		I worked on a team of five, each person responsible for a different task. Luckily, each person specialized or was interested in a field that divided up the teamwork pretty easily. We used a Ruby on Rails framework, Git, Heroku, and Slack to organize ourselves. I was in charge of front-end development and used the Bootstrap framework.

	<p>
		My main goal was to make the navigation and design as simple and clear as possible, so that survivors wouldn’t be discouraged by the site, and therefore, wouldn’t be discouraged from reporting the incident to anyone. I used a friendly, non-threatening light blue and white as the color scheme, as well as a nice, sans-serif font. Responsive design was also implemented to ensure a unified experience on any device.

		This site is currently being implemented into the University of Puget Sound’s servers and should be available for use in the Fall of 2015. As such, the link provided is an almost final version.

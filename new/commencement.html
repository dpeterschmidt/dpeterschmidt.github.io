	<h1>Commencement - The Film</h1>
	<h2>Student-produced feature film</h2>

	<br>

	<p>
		At the end of spring of 2012, I was approached by two students, Romene Davis and Liam Tully, who wanted to make a feature-length film. They had come across some of my photos on Tumblr and asked if I wanted to be Director of Photography on this film. I replied yes.
	</p>

	<p>
		The next six months were spent writing the film. Ariel Quintana and Romene Davis wanted to explore race, sexuality, and gender themes on a predominately white college campus spanning across decades. Inspired by The Hours and (the other one), the film takes place in three time periods: the 1940s, the 70s, and the 90s, each exploring a different theme. 
	</p>

	<p>
		After the film was written, we began pre-production meetings in December, casting the film (using students from the theater department), doing location scouting, and gathering equipment. I lobbied for the student government to buy a Canon 60D that could be used to rent by other students and succeeded. I also built a steadicam from parts I gathered at Home Depot, as well as a slider rig. We also were able to borrow lighting equipment from the school photographer, as well as a high quality boom microphone from my uncle who works in the film industry. We were trying to save as much money as we could.

	<!-- <b>The Process</b> -->
	<p>
		Principal photography began in January of 2013. Since the film was produced, directed, shot, and acted by students, the producer had to plan the shoots around everybody’s busy schedules. We usually shot on the weekends, about 6 hours a shoot, filming two scenes each day. 
	</p>

	<p>
		These shoots were usually grueling, as it was everyone’s first time working on a project of this scale. There was a lot of hands on learning that was required (some other detail). Shooting wrapped in May, right before everyone had finals.

	<!-- <b>The Solution</b> -->
	<p>
		The film was edited over the next five months. Since there was hundreds of gigabytes of footage to edit and a deadline by the end of October, myself and the sound producer, Greg, edited in tandem, dividing the work in half. Here was our workflow: using Adobe Premiere, After Effects, and DaVinci Resolve, Greg and I would both edit rough cuts and upload them to Youtube as unlisted so that other members of the team could give edits. Typically, each scene would go through 7-9 revisions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Looking back on the project, there are many things I would go back and fix. The camera work, the editing, and the script itself all make me cringe whenever I rewatch it. But, given the time we had, and that it was everyone’s first time working on a project of this scope, I am immensely proud of all the work that had gone into the year and half long project.

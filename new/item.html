	<h1>NPR Reddit AMA Cards</h1>
	<h2>Consistent advertising on social media</h2>

	<br>
	
	<!-- <b>The Problem</b> -->
	<p>
		Journalists at NPR often particpate in AMAs on Reddit. These present valuable opportunities to connect NPR directly to the reader and to build a sustainable connection with the audience. Previously, no method existed to properly and consistently advertise these AMAs via NPR's social media accounts.

	<!-- <b>The Process</b> -->
	<p>
		I was tasked by the Social Media team to create a card for this purpose. Using Sketch, I mocked up various layouts for different name lengths and options for journalists who did not have headshots. For example, if we had a headshot-less journalist who’s beat was legal affairs, we would include a relevant image of the Supreme Court in the background.

	<!-- <b>The Solution</b> -->
	<p>
		After the cards were developed, I created a Photoshop template of the card to replace name, photo, time, and date information, as well as documentation to assist those through the process who are not familar with Photoshop. This documentation also included art guidelines to help the Social Media team select and use the appropriate types of images. This card was approved by both the Design and Marketing teams with NPR and is currently in use.

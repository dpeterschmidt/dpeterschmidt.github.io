<h1>Delaney's Totally Not Lame <br>Fall Podcast Mixtape</h1>
<!-- <div style = "text-decoration:line-through;">Summer</div> -->
<br>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>
<p>I got some new podcast eps for ya. So you can listen to these when you're not practicing the clarinet or you're just super bored on a date or something. It seems like you're doing just fine with Indiana without us, we're not bitter.</p>
<br>
<p>For real though, I miss you super bad. Send me positive vibes that I can get a real people job and visit you soon.</p>
<p>Love, <br> Daniel</p>

<!-- <p style = "margin-top: 1%;">Hey bud! This is a list of some of my favorite podcast episodes...ever. Since there isn't an easy way to send all these in one place, with descriptions and links and bullshit, I made a shitty little website where you can listen to them all directly from your computer and phone. So...if you have any downtime at your job, just come over here, and have a listen. Enjoy!</p> -->

<h1 style = "margin-top: 2%; text-align:center; margin-left: 0%;">Millennial</h1>
<br>
<p style = "margin-top: -1%;">I feel like audio/music is the most emotionally direct medium and Megan Tan, a 24-year old recent graduate, takes full and complete advantage of that fact. Ever since I found her show in May, it's become one of my favorite podcasts ever. She perfectly captures the experience of many Millennials: graduating from college, trying to find a job that doesn't compromise your values, the emotionally and mentally gruelling search it takes to find a job in this ridiculously competitive market. Megan talks about her feelings in the most unflinchingly honest way, and that's what makes the show truly relatable. I'm linking the the first three episodes (since it's serialized), but you should really listen to the whole thing (currently nine episodes).</p>
<br>
<p>"Welcome To Millennial"</p>

<br><br>

<h1>Meet The Composer</h1>
<br>
<p>I can't believe I didn't put in eps from this the first time. We listened to 20 minutes of this on the drive to Portland once, but I want to link my two favorite episodes. Basically, it's the contemporary music history class you never you wanted.</p>

<br>

<p>"Caroline Shaw Lives Life Beautifully"</p>
<p>One of the most stunning and well-produced piece of audio I've heard. Caroline Shaw is an amazingly talented composer who was the youngest person to win a Pulitzer Prize in music EVER. She never had a formal music lessson in her life until she was accepted by Princeton University's PhD program in composition. She also took a year off to study historical gardens, whatever.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170505613&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>

<p>"A Connecticut Hippie In California"</p>
<p>Known as a "California Minimalist", Ingram Marshall composes stark and bare pieces that kinda make you stop in your tracks. Again, a completely fascinating dive into a composer's emotionally rich work.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="130" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/wqxr/#file=%2Faudio%2Fxspf%2F535949%2F"></iframe>

<br><br>

<h1>Reply All</h1>
<p>This show may be called "a podcast about the internet", but it's really about  extremely well-told stories about people's relationship with the internet, whether it's aided or hindered them in their personal lives.</p>

<br>

<p>"Undo, Undo, Undo"</p>
<p>This is a lighter episode that features Lulu and Alix from Invisibilia on a segment that the show calls "Yes Yes No", in which two people understand a thing on the internet and they explain it to the person who has no clue what it is. The second half is a hilarious story from a comedian about a mistake he wishes he could undo.</p>

<br><br>

<h1>Bonus Episodes</h1>

<p>"Ira Glass"</p>
<p>This is from Longform, a podcast that I've already linked to on this page. This is a wonderfully rich, hilarious, and poignant interview with public radio's superstar.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225243188&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>

<p>"Sylvan Esso: Coffee"</p>
<p>You've heard this show before. This feautures a fun deconstruction of the song 'Coffee'.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/213773263&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<h1>The Heart</h1>

<br>

<p>A little about the podcast first: it’s a gender and sexuality podcast which used to be called Audio Smut. Half the episodes they do are educational, This American Life-style stories, and the other half are basically erotica, but they have a really strong story element. They do freakin amazing things with audio production, stuff that no one else is doing in the audio world, that border more along the lines of art rather than craft. It’s visceral, intense, and intimate all at the same time.
</p>

<br>

<p>"First"</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the first episode of The Heart I listened to. It’s a great intro to the vibe of the show.
</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/184796982&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br>
<br>

<p>"The Hurricane"</p>
<p>A goofy, fun little story about a love that lasts only a few days during Hurricane Sandy.
</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/194089173&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>
<p>"Movies In Your Head"</p>
<p>One of the most powerful pieces of audio I’ve ever heard. The way they convey those incessant, infinite number of paranoid thoughts that run through your head when you’re beginning a relationship with someone is so well done it’s scary.
</p>

<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/155697268&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>
<p>"Kaitlin Prest"</p>
<p>Bonus addition! Here's the interview with the creator of The Heart about how she got the podcast started, which was just as hard as you think it would be to get a gender and sexuality podcast on the air. Not gonna lie, she's kinda my radio crush.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214019898&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br><br><br>

<h1>Longform</h1>
<p>This podcast goes in depth with writers from literary and news worlds. It’s not as exciting as it sounds, but the interviewers they have are prime and their subjects are primer. Even if writing isn’t your thing, it’s completely fascinating listening to these artists' backgrounds and their creative processes.
</p>

<br><br>

<p>"Rukmini Callimachi"</p>
<p>The New York Times ISIS correspondent. Has an absolutely fascinating process about how she communicates with ISIS militants to get info and sources for her stories. A lot of insightful things to say about the state of ISIS and what role it has to play in the future.</p>
<br>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/192009923&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br>
<br>

<p>"Cheryl Strayed"</p>
<p>Author of Wild, totally insightful interview about writing the book, super down to earth. Plus, she lives in Portland, so that's cool.
</p>
<br>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/209873367&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>

<p>"Tavi Gevinson"</p>
<p>She was 18 when this recorded last year (wtf???). The New Yorker profiled her when she was 13. She's a relatively high-profile fashion blogger, started her own online magazine (Rookie Magazine) when she was 16, gets dope interviews with people like Lorde and Carrie Brownstein. Incredibly intelligent and way more well-spoken than I will ever be.</p>
<br>

<br><br>
<p>"Mac McClelland"</p>
<p>This reporter went to Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 and came back with PTSD. She wrote a book called "Broken Hearts Syndrome" on how she dealt with the condition after leaving Haiti. Totally changed the way how I thought about the PTSD.</p>
<br>

<br><br><br><br>

<h1>Radiolab</h1>
<p>Radiolab has kinda been the gold standard of audio storytelling since podcasting was a thing. They mostly do science stories and are known for their amazing level of audio production.
</p>

<br><br>

<p>"60 Words"</p>
<p>A totally engrossing look at the 60 words that have shaped US foreign policy since 9/11. Couldn't get an embed, so hit the link below.
</p>
<br>
<a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/">60 Words</a>

<br><br><br><br>

<h1>Home Of The Brave</h1>
<p>You've heard this podcast before. You get the gist.</p>

<br><br>

<p>"Over There" & "Najibullah Comes To America"</p>
<p>Scott Carrier went to Afghanistan in the early 2000s to report on the war and needed a translator. He hired a local kid who spoke english and eventually teaches him how to write. The second part of the story is where it shines, but you need to listen to the first part for context. Couldn't get an embed link, so hit those links.

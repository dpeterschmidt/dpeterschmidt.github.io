<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h3>
      Alec Baldwin is high key a really incredible interviewer. His interviews are a mix of the interesting, intellectual human parts of shows like Fresh Air, but with the authenticness of a dude bro in a basement podcast, but in a really smart, New York-perspective Alec Baldwin-y way. The show is at its best when he talks to other actors he’s known for awhile, like this episode with Ellie Kemper.

      Often my favorite podcasts episodes are about topics that I haven’t give a second thought to but when you hear the topic you’re instantly like, of fucking course i’d listen to that that’s so fucking interesting. So…ever wonder what life is like for a puppeteer working on Sesame Street?

      This episode tackles the issue of whitewashing in Hollywood in an interesting way. By using the upcoming Ghost in the Shell movie as a frame, this episode examines the history of anime (which was way more interesting than I thought it would) and how western culture fits into Japanese culture and how that all fits into how we define whitewashing.

    <h3>
      You can’t go wrong with this show. Seriously, listen to all of it. Unlike most popular comedy podcasts, this isn’t a bunch of dudes sitting around shooting the shit until someone says something funny. The format here is more like a standup show Jessica Williams, from the Daily Show, and her friend Phoebe Robinson, host it, have meandering, hilarious, discussions about their lives interspersed with three standup comics. This show is diverse tktktk

      This was a side project podcast started by one of This American Life’s producers, Stephanie Foo. The idea behind this podcast (which unfortunately only has two episodes at the moment) was to introduce and give away free ideas for podcasts that anyone could use. The first episode is the only good one. Pretty simple concept, Foo and Glass both play some entertaining tape from the first radio pieces they did.

    <h3>
      This podcast only lasted a season, but damn if it didn’t have some of the best tape I’ve heard in audio. This podcast served as a marketing effort for the startup incubator called Betaworks. They hired this woman who hadn’t worked in tech or audio before to make a podcast about life as an intern in New York, what it’s like working for a tech company, what life is like in NY, etc. And despite this person having no experience (check) in audio, she made a pretty dang good, serialized, first person podcast. This episode comes in halfway through the series as she’s trying to figure out how to ask for a raise at her job. What follows is some of the most compelling and hard to listen tape, featuring an uncomfortable but fascinating fly on the wall perspective of her asking her boss for a raise.

      Coppins is the reporter at Buzzfeed who covers Trump. He’s been covering him since 2014, since he wrote a long form piece that proclaimed that Trump would never run for president. Many think that this was the straw that broke the camel’s back and finally pushed Trump to run. Normally, I hate consuming any media that involves Trump, but Coppins tells a riveting and strange story of a weekend in 2014 that stranded him at Trump’s resort in Mara Lago. They also go into Coppins upbringing as a Mormon.

      This is one of the most entertaining interviews I’ve ever listened to. Jack Hitt is a long time producer from This American Life who’s most well-known story is included earlier in this list (The Apartment). This guy basically seems to constantly run across super interesting stories and also happens to be really funny. As per one of the questions asked “Do just run into these stories or do you actively seek them?”

      So you’ve probably seen clips from the roast of Rob Lowe that was high key actually a roast of Ann Coulter. Jeff Ross co-created the show and Terry really interestingly dissects why he thinks the Roast format works so well, it which cases it totally didn’t work, and where the super brutal jokes of roasting fit within today’s “PC culture.”

      Honestly, I could listen to hours of Scott Carrier. Just the most soothing voice. This the same guy who went to that republican kid rock concert and dropped acid while trying to report.

    <h3>
      I was hesitant about including this one. The producer of this episode gets cat-called in the street and instead of ignoring the guy or telling him off, she pulls out her microphone and interviews him, asking him why he cat calls. It provides a humanizing insight into these seemingly inhuman people. That doesn’t make what they’re doing okay, this just isn’t a story you hear that often.

<h1>Delaney's Totally Not Lame <br>Fall Podcast Mixtape</h1>
<br>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>
<p>I got some new podcast eps for ya. So you can listen to these when you're not practicing the clarinet or you're just super bored on a date or something. It seems like you're doing just fine with Indiana without us, we're not bitter.</p>
<br>
<p>For real though, I miss you super bad. Send me positive vibes that I can get a real people job and visit you soon.</p>
<p>Love, <br> Daniel</p>


<hr>

<h1 style = "margin-top: 2%; text-align:center; margin-left: 0%;">Millennial</h1>
<br>
<p style = "margin-top: -1%;">I feel like audio/music is the most emotionally direct medium and Megan Tan, a 24-year old recent graduate, takes full and complete advantage of that fact. Ever since I found her show in May, it's become one of my favorite podcasts ever. She perfectly captures the experience of many Millennials: graduating from college, trying to find a job that doesn't compromise your values, the emotionally and mentally gruelling search it takes to find a job in this ridiculously competitive market. Megan talks about her feelings in the most unflinchingly honest way, and that's what makes the show truly relatable. I'm linking the the first three episodes (since it's serialized), but you should really listen to the whole thing (currently nine episodes).</p>
<br>
<p>"Welcome To Millennial"</p>

<br><br>

<h1>Meet The Composer</h1>
<br>
<p>I can't believe I didn't put in eps from this the first time. We listened to 20 minutes of this on the drive to Portland once, but I want to link my two favorite episodes. Basically, it's the contemporary music history class you never you wanted.</p>

<br>

<p>"Caroline Shaw Lives Life Beautifully"</p>
<p>One of the most stunning and well-produced piece of audio I've heard. Caroline Shaw is an amazingly talented composer who was the youngest person to win a Pulitzer Prize in music EVER. She never had a formal music lessson in her life until she was accepted by Princeton University's PhD program in composition. She also took a year off to study historical gardens, whatever.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/170505613&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>

<p>"A Connecticut Hippie In California"</p>
<p>Known as a "California Minimalist", Ingram Marshall composes stark and bare pieces that kinda make you stop in your tracks. Again, a completely fascinating dive into a composer's emotionally rich work.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="130" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/wqxr/#file=%2Faudio%2Fxspf%2F535949%2F"></iframe>

<br><br>

<h1>Reply All</h1>
<p>This show may be called "a podcast about the internet", but it's really about  extremely well-told stories about people's relationship with the internet, whether it's aided or hindered them in their personal lives.</p>

<br>

<p>"Undo, Undo, Undo"</p>
<p>This is a lighter episode that features Lulu and Alix from Invisibilia on a segment that the show calls "Yes Yes No", in which two people understand a thing on the internet and they explain it to the person who has no clue what it is. The second half is a hilarious story from a comedian about a mistake he wishes he could undo.</p>

<br><br>

<h1>Bonus Episodes</h1>

<p>"Ira Glass"</p>
<p>This is from Longform, a podcast that I've already linked to on this page. This is a wonderfully rich, hilarious, and poignant interview with public radio's superstar.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225243188&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>

<p>"Sylvan Esso: Coffee"</p>
<p>You've heard this show before. This feautures a fun deconstruction of the song 'Coffee'.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/213773263&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<h1>The Heart</h1>

<br>

<p>A little about the podcast first: it’s a gender and sexuality podcast which used to be called Audio Smut. Half the episodes they do are educational, This American Life-style stories, and the other half are basically erotica, but they have a really strong story element. They do freakin amazing things with audio production, stuff that no one else is doing in the audio world, that border more along the lines of art rather than craft. It’s visceral, intense, and intimate all at the same time.
</p>

<br>

<p>"First"</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the first episode of The Heart I listened to. It’s a great intro to the vibe of the show.

<br>
<br>

<p>"The Hurricane"</p>
<p>A goofy, fun little story about a love that lasts only a few days during Hurricane Sandy.
</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/194089173&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>
<p>"Movies In Your Head"</p>
<p>One of the most powerful pieces of audio I’ve ever heard. The way they convey those incessant, infinite number of paranoid thoughts that run through your head when you’re beginning a relationship with someone is so well done it’s scary.
</p>

<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/155697268&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>
<p>"Kaitlin Prest"</p>
<p>Bonus addition! Here's the interview with the creator of The Heart about how she got the podcast started, which was just as hard as you think it would be to get a gender and sexuality podcast on the air. Not gonna lie, she's kinda my radio crush.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214019898&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br><br><br>

<h1>Longform</h1>
<p>This podcast goes in depth with writers from literary and news worlds. It’s not as exciting as it sounds, but the interviewers they have are prime and their subjects are primer. Even if writing isn’t your thing, it’s completely fascinating listening to these artists' backgrounds and their creative processes.
</p>

<p>"Rukmini Callimachi"</p>
<p>The New York Times ISIS correspondent. Has an absolutely fascinating process about how she communicates with ISIS militants to get info and sources for her stories. A lot of insightful things to say about the state of ISIS and what role it has to play in the future.</p>

<p>"Cheryl Strayed"</p>

<p>"Tavi Gevinson"</p>
<p>She was 18 when this recorded last year (wtf???). The New Yorker profiled her when she was 13. She's a relatively high-profile fashion blogger, started her own online magazine (Rookie Magazine) when she was 16, gets dope interviews with people like Lorde and Carrie Brownstein. Incredibly intelligent and way more well-spoken than I will ever be.</p>

<p>"Mac McClelland"</p>
<p>This reporter went to Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 and came back with PTSD. She wrote a book called "Broken Hearts Syndrome" on how she dealt with the condition after leaving Haiti. Totally changed the way how I thought about the PTSD.</p>

<p>You've heard this podcast before. You get the gist.</p>

<p>"Over There" & "Najibullah Comes To America"</p>
<p>Scott Carrier went to Afghanistan in the early 2000s to report on the war and needed a translator. He hired a local kid who spoke english and eventually teaches him how to write. The second part of the story is where it shines, but you need to listen to the first part for context. Couldn't get an embed link, so hit those links.

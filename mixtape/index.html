<h1>Delaney's Totally Not Lame Summer <br> Podcast Mixtape</h1>
<br>

<p style = "margin-top: 1%;">Hey bud! This is a list of some of my favorite podcast episodes...ever. Since there isn't an easy way to send all these in one place, with descriptions and links and bullshit, I made a shitty little website where you can listen to them all directly from your computer and phone. So...if you have any downtime at your job, just come over here, and have a listen. Enjoy!</p>


<h1 style = "margin-top: 2%; text-align:center; margin-left: 0%;">The Heart</h1>

<br>

<p style = "margin-top: -1%;">A little about the podcast first: it’s a gender and sexuality podcast which used to be called Audio Smut. Half the episodes they do are educational, This American Life-style stories, and the other half are basically erotica, but they have a really strong story element. They do freakin amazing things with audio production, stuff that no one else is doing in the audio world, that border more along the lines of art rather than craft. It’s visceral, intense, and intimate all at the same time.
</p>

<br>

<p>"First"</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the first episode of The Heart I listened to. It’s a great intro to the vibe of the show.

<br>
<br>

<p>"The Hurricane"</p>
<p>A goofy, fun little story about a love that lasts only a few days during Hurricane Sandy.
</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/194089173&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>
<p>"Movies In Your Head"</p>
<p>One of the most powerful pieces of audio I’ve ever heard. The way they convey those incessant, infinite number of paranoid thoughts that run through your head when you’re beginning a relationship with someone is so well done it’s scary.
</p>

<br><br>
<p>"Kaitlin Prest"</p>
<p>Bonus addition! Here's the interview with the creator of The Heart about how she got the podcast started, which was just as hard as you think it would be to get a gender and sexuality podcast on the air. Not gonna lie, she's kinda my radio crush.</p>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214019898&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<h1>Longform</h1>
<p>This podcast goes in depth with writers from literary and news worlds. It’s not as exciting as it sounds, but the interviewers they have are prime and their subjects are primer. Even if writing isn’t your thing, it’s completely fascinating listening to these artists' backgrounds and their creative processes.
</p>

<br><br>

<p>"Rukmini Callimachi"</p>
<p>The New York Times ISIS correspondent. Has an absolutely fascinating process about how she communicates with ISIS militants to get info and sources for her stories. A lot of insightful things to say about the state of ISIS and what role it has to play in the future.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>"Cheryl Strayed"</p>
<p>Author of Wild, totally insightful interview about writing the book, super down to earth. Plus, she lives in Portland, so that's cool.
</p>
<br>
<iframe width="80%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/209873367&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<br><br>

<p>"Tavi Gevinson"</p>
<p>She was 18 when this recorded last year (wtf???). The New Yorker profiled her when she was 13. She's a relatively high-profile fashion blogger, started her own online magazine (Rookie Magazine) when she was 16, gets dope interviews with people like Lorde and Carrie Brownstein. Incredibly intelligent and way more well-spoken than I will ever be.</p>

<br><br>
<p>"Mac McClelland"</p>
<p>This reporter went to Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 and came back with PTSD. She wrote a book called "Broken Hearts Syndrome" on how she dealt with the condition after leaving Haiti. Totally changed the way how I thought about the PTSD.</p>

<h1>Radiolab</h1>
<p>Radiolab has kinda been the gold standard of audio storytelling since podcasting was a thing. They mostly do science stories and are known for their amazing level of audio production.
</p>

<br><br>

<p>"60 Words"</p>
<p>A totally engrossing look at the 60 words that have shaped US foreign policy since 9/11. Couldn't get an embed, so hit the link below.

<br><br><br><br>

<h1>Home Of The Brave</h1>
<p>You've heard this podcast before. You get the gist.</p>

<br><br>

<p>"Over There" & "Najibullah Comes To America"</p>
<p>Scott Carrier went to Afghanistan in the early 2000s to report on the war and needed a translator. He hired a local kid who spoke english and eventually teaches him how to write. The second part of the story is where it shines, but you need to listen to the first part for context. Couldn't get an embed link, so hit those links.
